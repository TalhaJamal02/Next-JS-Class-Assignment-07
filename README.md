# Client & Server-Side Data Fetching
This project demonstrates both client-side and server-side data fetching in a React application. It showcases how to fetch and display data dynamically from an external API in two different ways: fetching data on the client-side and fetching data on the server-side. The application fetches a list of books from a public API and displays them in an appealing card layout, featuring details such as name, type, availability, and position.

## Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
 ### Dynamic Data Fetching:
- **Server-side fetching**: Data is fetched on the server when the page loads, ensuring fresh content.
- **Client-side fetching**: Data is fetched on the client after the initial page load for a smoother user experience.
- **Interactive UI**: Cards are styled with hover effects and icons to improve user interaction.

## Key Technologies:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
### API Fetching:
- Client-side fetching with **useEffect** and **fetch()** for real-time data updates.
